Datasets and code used to create the figures inside the article. 
The title of the article is Decomposing near-bed velocity to diagnose near-bed transport under plunging and spilling breaker.
Inside the folder PAPER2_DATA, there are eight sub folder contains data and code to produce the figure, as following:
-CONC_COMBINE: containing SINBAD and LIPC cross-shore concentration data and code
-DECOM_LIPC: All decomposition results for the LIPC case, and tthe decomposition code
-DECOM_SINBAD: All decomposition results for the SINBAD case, and the decomposition code
-FS_NB_VELOCITY:SINBAD free-stream and near-bed velocity data, and the code
-IRREGULAR_PLOT:Hrms and velocity for LIPC and the code
-REGULAR_HS:Hs for the SINBAD and the code
-SK_AS: Regular LIPC velocity and the code
-TAUBED_PLOT:SINBAD bed shear stress decomposition and code
-TRANS_IRREG:LIPC transport rate and code
-TRANS_REG:SINBAD transport rate and code
-Undertow: Undertow data and code
